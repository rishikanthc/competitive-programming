## LeetCode Solutions

This repo holds my solutions for questions on LeetCode. As and when I solve questions, I keep updating this repo with the answers.


The repo is organized based on the question numbers. Each question on LeetCode has a unique number index which is used as the file name. For eg. 983.py is the solution for question 983: [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/)
The solutions are all in python for now.
